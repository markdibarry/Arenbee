Stalone: Hello, friend. You don't know me, but I come from a far away place.
Threena: Is that you, Stalone?

Stalone: I come from the bathroom! [speed = 10]...[/speed] of the future!!
Twosen: Oh my GAWD. Did you clog the toilet... AGAIN?
Stalone ["happy"]: Why don't you go look?
Threena: UGH. Why can't I have my own car, so I can drive away from this conversation?
Twosen ["annoyed"]: It was the size of a house cat!
Cat: Meow meow!
